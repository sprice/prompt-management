## Creating Prompts

### Prompt Structure

Each prompt consists of two files in its own directory under `prompts/`:

1. `prompt.md`: Contains the prompt template with variables in the format `{{variableName}}`
2. `config.yml`: Contains prompt configuration including:
   - Provider settings (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
   - Model selection
   - Temperature and other parameters
   - Variable definitions

### Example Configuration

```yaml
provider: openai
model: gpt-4
temperature: 0.7
system_message: You are an AI assistant specialized in spelling.
user_message: How many letter R's are there in the word strawberry?
```
